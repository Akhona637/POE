### Description of Changes Based on Lecturerâ€™s Feedback

The Recipe App now includes a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application instead of a console application, offering a more user-friendly graphical interface in response to the lecturer's feedback. The new design has kept and improved the essential features, such uploading and presenting recipes as well as filtering them according to different parameters (like ingredient, food group, and calories).

Key changes include:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The transition from a command-line interface to a WPF-based GUI makes the application more accessible and visually appealing.
- **Filter Functionality**: A new window (`FilterRecipesWindow`) was added to allow users to filter recipes based on ingredients, food groups, and maximum calorie content.
- **Code Refactoring**: The code was refactored to separate concerns more effectively, with dedicated classes for managing recipes (`RecipeManager`), and handling ingredients (`Ingredient`) and recipes (`Recipe`).
